## Operations Manager

This is an application to record activities related to your operation

Examples of activities include:
 
1. Plant Introduction: Obtaining a seed packet, seed starts or plant
2. Plant Activity: Each activity with a seed or plant
3. Observation notes pertaining to a plant
4. Spaces: Define areas where plants may be grown, such as in a greenhouse, or in a bed outside


Initially, data will be stored in csv databases:
* growables.csv - contains entries about seed packets, packs of starts, or individual plants purchased
* observations.csv - a log of various observations or natural events the plants experience as they develop (pests, frost)
* activities.csv - a log of specific actions taken for the plants (pre-plant soak, planting, transplanting/setting out, 
thinning, fertilizing, etc.)
